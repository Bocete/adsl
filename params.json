{"name":"ADSL","tagline":"An Abstract Data Store Language Parser and Translator","body":"ADSL - Abstract Data Store Language Parser and Translator\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nThis tool an Abstract Data Store Language (ADSL) specification verification tool.\r\n\r\nADSL is a language for specifying Abstract Data Stores using a syntax familiar to anyone that has experience\r\nwith ORM tools such as Hibernate and ActiveRecord. A specification contains the model classes, actions executed\r\nusing a RESTful interface, and a set of invariants to be verified.\r\n\r\nThis tool verifies a specification by translating it into a first order logic theorem verifiable by [Spass] [1],\r\na theorem prover. It provides detailed information on the actions and invariants verified in human-readable or\r\nCSV format.\r\n\r\nThis tool is distributed as a Ruby gem and is uploaded to [RubyGems.org] [2]. Install it and give it a try!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis gem is tested on 32 and 64 bit Linux. OS-X compatibility not tested, give it a try\r\nand tell us if it works! Windows is not supported at this moment.\r\n\r\n - Ruby 1.8.7 or later required. We suggest using the [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) to manage this installation.\r\n - [Download and install Spass](http://www.spass-prover.org/download/index.html) and make sure its executable (`bin/SPASS`) on your $PATH\r\n - Install the ADSL gem by running `gem install adsl`.\r\n   \r\n   If you receive an error while generating documentation for 'activesupport' run `gem install rdoc adsl` instead.\r\n - Test the installation by verifying [the example specification](https://raw.github.com/Bocete/adsl/master/example/running-example.adsl)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    adsl-verify <specification-file>\r\n\r\nFor options and other modes of operation, run\r\n\r\n    adsl-verify --help\r\n\r\nYou can download sample ADSL specifications \r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### Source Repository\r\n\r\nThe ADSL gem is currently hosted at github.
