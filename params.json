{"name":"ADSL","tagline":"ADSL - Abstract Data Store Library","body":"ADSL - Abstract Data Store Library\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nADSL is a gem for formal verification of Ruby on Rails models.  Simply include it in your Gemfile, write a few \r\ninvariants (rules) about ActiveRecord data that you wish to verify (for example, that at any given moment, every\r\nAddress has a User) and run `rake verify`!\r\n\r\nBesides the verification algorithm, this tool includes a DSL for specifying invariants.  The syntax should feel\r\nnatural to any Rails user. Look at /examples.\r\n\r\nThis tool is distributed as a Ruby gem and is uploaded to [RubyGems.org] [2]. It requires Spass[1] to run. Install\r\nit and give it a try!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis gem is tested on 32 and 64 bit Linux. OS-X compatibility not tested, give it a try\r\nand tell us if it works! Windows is not supported at this moment.\r\n\r\n - Ruby 1.9.3 or later required, along with Rails 3.2.  We suggest using the [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) to manage this installation.\r\n - [Download and install Spass](http://www.spass-prover.org/download/index.html) and make sure its executable (`bin/SPASS`) on your $PATH\r\n - Install the ADSL gem by running `gem install adsl`.\r\n   If you receive an error while generating documentation for 'activesupport' run `gem install rdoc adsl` instead.\r\n \r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    rake verify <options>\r\n    \r\nOr, to just observe the extracted model,\r\n\r\n    rake adsl_translate\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### Source Repository\r\n\r\nThe ADSL gem is currently hosted at github.
